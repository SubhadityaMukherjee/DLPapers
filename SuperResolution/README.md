**[33]** Super Resolution using Sub Pixel Convolutions
- Shi, W., Caballero, J., Husz√°r, F., Totz, J., Aitken, A. P., Bishop, R., ... & Wang, Z. (2016). Real-time single image and video super-resolution using an efficient sub-pixel convolutional neural network. In Proceedings of the IEEE conference on computer vision and pattern recognition (pp. 1874-1883).

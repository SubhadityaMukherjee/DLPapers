## Notes
- Inception module
- Network in Network -> 1x1 convolutions
- Solve overfitting+large mem -> replace FC layers with sparse
- Ratio of 3x3 and 5x5 convolutions should increase in higher layers
- Dimensionality reduction
- Merge outputs of best models
- Approximate expected optimal sparse structure by using dense blocks
- Shallow and narrower Architecture
